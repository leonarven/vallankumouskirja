Stand up all victims of oppression<br>
For the tyrants fear your might<br>
Don't cling so hard to your possessions<br>
For you have nothing if you have no rights<br>
Let racist ignorance be ended<br>
For respect makes the empires fall<br>
Freedom is merely privilege extended<br>
Unless enjoyed by one and all<br>
<br>
So come friends and comrades<br>
For the struggle carries on<br>
The internationale<br>
Unites the world in song<br>
So comrades come rally<br>
For this is the time and place<br>
The international ideal<br>
Unites the human race<br>
<br>
Let no one build walls to divide us<br>
Walls of hatred nor walls of stone<br>
Come greet the dawn and stand beside us<br>
We'll live together or we'll die alone<br>
In our world poisoned by exploitation<br>
Those who have taken now they must give<br>
And end the vanity of nations<br>
We've but one earth on which to live<br>
<br>
So come brothers and sisters... (x2)<br>
