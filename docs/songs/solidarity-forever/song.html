(Chorus): Solidarity forever, solidarity forever<br>
Solidarity forever, for the Union makes us strong<br>
<br>
When the union's inspiration through the workers' blood shall run<br>
There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun<br>
Yet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one<br>
For the Union makes us strong<br>
<br>
(Chorus) Solidarity forever...<br>
<br>
It is we who ploughed the prairies, built the cities where they trade<br>
Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad laid<br>
Now we stand outcast and starving 'mid the wonders we have made<br>
But the union makes us strong<br>
<br>
(Chorus) Solidarity forever...<br>
<br>
They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn<br>
But without our brain and muscle not a single wheel can turn<br>
We can break their haughty power, gain our freedom when we learn<br>
That the Union makes us strong<br>
<br>
(Chorus) Solidarity foreverâ€¦<br>
<br>
In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold<br>
Greater than the might of armies magnified a thousandfold<br>
We can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old<br>
For the Union makes us strong<br>
